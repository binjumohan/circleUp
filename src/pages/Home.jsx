          </h2>

         
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed p-2 m-4"> <span className="font-bold">Circle Up </span>is built to strengthen local communities by making events easier to 
          discover and attend. We believe that meaningful connections  happen when people 
          come together in real life — through shared interests, celebrations, and experiences.</p> 

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed p-2 m-4">Our platform highlights events happening in your neighborhood, from cultural 
          programs and workshops to meetups, sports activities, and social gatherings. 
          Whether you’re new to a city or a long-time resident, Circle Up helps you stay 
          connected to what’s happening around you.</p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed p-2 m-4">We also empower local organizers by giving them a simple way to promote events, 
          reach the right audience, and build stronger communities. By bringing people and 
          events together in one place, we aim to make every local event more visible, 
          accessible, and impactful.</p>
